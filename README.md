# simulation-neural-network-blind-data
An implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network on Blind Data set as a C# console application. It was aimed to obtain the best results by trying different hyper- parameter values and some regularization techniques in the two versions of Gradient descent algorithm (On-line/Batch).
